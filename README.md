Problem Statement

Consider the problem of Chinese auction or penny social. We will refer to it as simple “Auction.” It is a 
conventional approach
used for fundraising for a cause. The organizers collect items to be auctioned off 
for raising funds. Before the auction, the items for auctions are received and arranged each with a bowl 
to place the bid.  A chairperson is a special person among the orga
nizers. She/he heads the effort and is 
the  only  person  who  can  determine  the  winner  by  random  drawing  at  the  end of  the  auction.  A  set  of 
bidders buy sheets of tickets with their money. The bidder’s sheet has a stub that identifies the bidder’s 
number, and
tokens bought.
The bidders examine the items to bid, place the one or more tickets in the bowl in front of the items they 
desire to bid for until all the tickets are used. After the auction period ends the chairperson, collects the 
bowls, randomly selects
a ticket from each item’s bowl to determine the winning bidder for that item. The 
item is  transferred  to  the  winning  bidder.  Total  money  collected  is  the  fund raised  by  the  penny  social 
auction.
